# Meme syntax

This document stores the syntax documentation for the **meme programming language**

**DISCLAIMER**

This programming language is not intended to be used as an actual tool, rather as a... meme. It's not meant to be good.

# Ideas

The main idea is to put as many easter eggs and fun syntax in this programming language as possible. Things like the compiler shutting down if a 
specific statement is used or a window popping up trying to advertise a non-existent product. General fun stuff, so as little seriousnous as possible
